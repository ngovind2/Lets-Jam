# Let's Jam

Let's Jam is a fun and collaborative soundboard that allows friends to create music together. Users can join "jam sessions" through unique devices, and begin mixing tracks using the virtual mix pad. From jazz to house to pop, music lovers can mix instrumental loops in real-time, with the output broadcasted as an audio track to all participants.

As a team of 4, we were inspired to create this project for Hack Western by a mutual love for music and a desire to create our own mixes together. This web app aims to help even more friends create memorable social experiences through music.
